This is a game based on C & SDL.

## Introduction

In the game, the player will act as a commander who's trying to win a battle in a region. 

The region is rectangle shaped, with grids specifing little areas. At the beginning, both 

player and computer will have it's own *commander base* at one random square in the most 

left/right edge of the region, at each round, the player can contact with his/her soldiers 

to send commands, and at the same time decide which type of new soldiers does he/she need 

as backups. The whole fighting process is automatically calculated base on the landform as 

well as the property of the soldiers. All player can see is a rectangle area as map, with 

parts of visible grids on it, the visibility of places could only be found out by the 

communication with soldiers. The *commander base* has it's own real time sight, and can be

resettled as desired.

Satisfying any of the following requirement will be considered winning:

1. Destroy opponent's *commander base*.

2. Occupying one of two opponent's *winning fortress* for enough rounds.

3. The opponent resigned.

4. The opponent reaches any losing condition.
